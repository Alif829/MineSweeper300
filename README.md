# MineSweeper300
A text based minesweeper game displayed and played from the console.  Input is received via Scanner and output is created from print statements.

I created this after completing CS 300. This is my second version of creating a minesweeper game, the first being the one I created after CS 200. This game was created as an improvement to my original and to practice what I learned in CS 300. MineSweeper200 was also played from the console but the source code was very hard to understand and I did not use many methods to organize it as I was a beginner programmer. This 300 version will be designed better and be an actual project.

### To Do:
- [x] Create all classes
- [ ] Create JUnit tests
- [ ] Test BoardTile class
- [ ] Test GameBoard class
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Code method to print board

#### Future Plans
- A MineSweeper400 version after completeting CS 400. That version will be a JavaFX GUI based application that can hopefully be a standalone download.
- Making Conway's Game of Life with JavaFX
